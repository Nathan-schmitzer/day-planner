This is my day planner! 
In this day planner time is displayed and there are text area's you can type into (although hard to read what you type, I couldn't find out how to change the color of text within the text area). The time slots are colored based upon past, present and future. past being red, grey meaning present, and light blue meaning future. text gets saved to local storage, but does not display when refreshed, would love any assistance with getting that last bit solved!
